# rustpython-doc

This `rustpython-doc` package contains all `__doc__` database in forms of `docs.inc.rs`. 

## How to update `__doc__` in RustPython

Adding a remake in front of `[pyclass]` of `[pyfunction]` will simply make the documentation to themselves, however, we do not manually add docs anymore.

Therefore you must update `docs.in.rs`, if it is unnecessary to different from cpython's `__doc__`

## How to update `docs.in.rs`

To update  `__doc__` for newer python version:

```
$ python generate_docs.py {RustPython PATH} ./docs.inc.rs
```
This will iterate all stdlib modules to inspect their `__doc__`, updating your local `docs.in.rs` file. Since RustPython is only able to access the database in this online package, the changes must be merged into this branch.

After that, update cargo:
```
$ cargo update
```
## Why the `__doc__` is not changed?

### Check if it is related to the unclosed issue
There is still some issue with `generate_docs.py`
- https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/issues/3973



### Check if the old remark documentation are not removed yet

RustPython prioritizes the user define documentation first. Check if old remarks remaining in the source code, and remove them.
